<h1>Hello, I'm Hugo 😄 </h1>

 <h2>Rugby 🏉</h2>
<p>
	I played rugby in Bordeaux for 6 years at Stade Bordelais Rugby. For me, rugby is an essential sport in my life because it allows me to maintain a continuous sporting activity but also to be able to spend time with my friends and share good times. Sport is a good way to relieve the difficulties of everyday life.

<h2>Trips 🌍</h2>
<p>
	I had the chance to travel a lot with my family. I tkink I have been to more than 30 countries like Tanzania, USA, Italy and so on.I like to travel because I can see other cultures and meet new people.I enjoy talking with people, walking in the srteets and learning more about the history of the country. My favourite trip was Tanzania because we did safaries, we saw lions, elephants and hippopotamus. Later, I would like to work internationally because I love to travel, learn, get out of my comfort zone and above all discover.
